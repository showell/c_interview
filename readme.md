This repository is slightly mis-named as `c_interview`, since
most of the interview-prep examples here ended up being in
Python.

A good way to re-engage yourself in a language like C, where
you may be rusty, is to solve problems in Python first, and
then try the C solution. I think I did this here once or
twice.

Anyway, these are code samples that I would study when I
prepped for coding interviews. Since they are programs
that I actually wrote, then after I study them, it should
be easier for me to recall any tricks or gotchas that
are present in problems.
